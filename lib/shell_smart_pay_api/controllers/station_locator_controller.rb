module ShellSmartPayApi
  # StationLocatorController
  class StationLocatorController < BaseController
    # Returns all sites within specified radius of specified GPS location. Sites
    # of all Types are returned. This call must be used when attempting to
    # establish the station the user is located at as part of fuelling journey
    # (i.e. user has to be within 300m of station to be considered located at
    # the station). This API could also be used as a general query to find
    # nearby Shell locations
    # @param [String] m Required parameter: API Method to be executed
    # @param [Float] lon Required parameter: The user’s current longitude
    # @param [Float] lat Required parameter: The user’s current latitude
    # @param [Float] radius Required parameter: The search radius in
    # kilometers
    # @param [String] offer_code Optional parameter: This enables requestor to
    # specify locations that will honour the specified (advanced) offer code
    # @param [Integer] n Optional parameter: This enables requestor to limit the
    # number of locations that are returned and defaulted to a maximum of 250
    # locations. Locations returned based on distance to User’s location
    # as-the-crow-flies.
    # @param [Array[String]] amenities Optional parameter: This enables
    # requestor to filter locations based on one or more amenities (e.g. Filter
    # locations so that only those with a Toilet are returned).
    # @param [Array[String]] countries Optional parameter: This enables
    # requestor to filter locations based on one or more Countries (i.e. by
    # country codes).
    # @param [TypeEnum] type Optional parameter: All fuel stations are of at
    # least one Type, indicating whether it is Shell-branded or not, and if the
    # station can be used by trucks. Note that a station can have more than one
    # Type (e.g. Shell retail sites (Type=0) can also be truck friendly
    # (Type=2)).   Type values are as follows:    * 0 = Shell owned/branded
    # stations that are not also Type=2 or Type=3   * 1 = Partner stations
    # accepting Shell Card   * 2 = Shell owned/branded stations that are truck
    # friendly but not Type=3   * 3 = Shell owned/branded stations that are
    # truck only   <br/>**When type is not provided, API will return type 0 and
    # 2 only.**
    # @return [AroundLocationArray] response from the API call.
